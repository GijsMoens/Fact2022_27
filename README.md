All the graph embeddings and  results of the 'influence maximization', 'link prediction' and 'node classication' can be found in the data folder under the name of the specific dataset under consideration.

These can also be generated by running the 'run_reproduction' (for reproducing the data from CrossWalk: Fairness-enhanced Node Representation Learning) and 'run_synthx' for generating synthetic data and the results of our extension (including moonwalk.) and setting the correct parameters (current settings should suffice to obtain the correct embeddings). Note that generating all data from scratch takes quite a while (>20hr). Also note that on Windows the local path to the python.exe file must be specified. 


The 'figures' folder contains all figures present in the paper. They can also be recreated by running the notebooks in the 'notebooks' folder.
